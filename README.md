# MET 330 - Final Project
Dr. Kevin Goebbert  
Fall 2018  

### **Due Date: 11 December 2016 at 4:00 pm**  
## Objectives
* Utilize your cumulative computer programming knowledge to answer a question(s) related to meteorology

## Problem 
1.	Define a meteorological question(s) that you want to answer through writing a FORTRAN or Python program. The program that you write must answer the question(s) you are asking. Any figures are supplements to answering your question(s) and ideally pertain directly to and also include the answer(s) that your program determines. Your question must be complex enough to fulfill the following requirements:
  
 a.	Use two meteorological datasets (two different datasets) and one of the datasets must be a new dataset that has not been used in class (e.g., SST data, win/loss record of sports team). You may use either FORTRAN or Python.   
  
 b.	Your program must include: 
  
  *	at least 2 calculations not previously computed in a class assignment (think about all of those equations that you know from various meteorology, math, and physics classes!) – calculations could be written by you or utilize a “high-level” function from an existing module in a creative way.
  *	subroutines/functions or definitions
  *	arrays
  *	comments 
  
  c. Datasets can be downloaded (preferred) from the Internet to your account or use OPeNDAP/THREDDS to access them remotely. Be sure to cite your data source (the website, ftp site, etc.) in the comments of your program (if you don’t, it is plagiarism, and you will fail this project!!).  Be sure to specify your directory for the input files. 

  * Some web sites with data include: <br>
        http://esrl.noaa.gov/raobs/ <br>
https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/datasets <br>
http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/ <br>
http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/ <br>
http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/cgi-bin/data/composites/printpage.pl  <br>
	(create a plot, then download the text dataset used to create the plot)<br>
http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/recon.php<br>
ftp://rammftp.cira.colostate.edu/demaria/ebtrk/<br>
http://rammb.cira.colostate.edu/research/tropical_cyclones/ships/<br>
https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/maps/<br>
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/<br>

  * Use only government (.gov) or university (.edu) web sites for data, other datasets must be approved by the instructor. 
  
  d.	Use your Imagination!!!!! Have fun with this assignment. Creativity is worth points!
  
  e.	You will be graded on format, commenting, output, etc.  Basically everything we've learned this semester.
  
  f.	Don't procrastinate!! Don't wait until Nov. 26th to get started! 
  
  g.	Honor code: You may help each other debug and figure out the logic, but create your own design and do your own programming.  If you use code from an outside source, cite it!  You may ask the instructor for help.
  
  h.	You may turn in your program anytime before the final time. When you finish, send your instructor an e-mail with your program name. Be sure to write your program so that anyone running it has access to the data (/home/yourname/met330/dataset.....) and output goes to an unspecified directory.
  
  i.	Please do not make this a user input program, set all the choices in the code.  If you want to run different scenarios or dates, run them all and have all the results go to the output.  In other words, we want to run the program and look at an output file(s).  
  
  j. You may turn in your program anytime before the final time. When you finish, print out a copy of your program code and put it in my mailbox.

  k. You’ll give a presentation about your project (the problem you are solving and how you went about solving it using computer programming) during the final examination period on Monday 10 December 2018 at 1 pm – the final version of your project code should be submitted to github and printed by 4 pm on Monday 10 December 2018.

  l. 	Grading 10% each based on:
  
   * Effective use of datasets
   * At least two new calculations
   * Use of subroutines/functions (FORTRAN) or definitions (Python)– more than one minimally
   * Use of arrays – effective use, more than one minimally
   * Effective use of comments (cite data sources); including use of github
   * Creativity
   * Graphics/Output file format
   * Clarity of coding
   * Brevity of coding  (effective use of loops, definitions, OPeNDAP, etc.)
   * Presentation to class on your project
